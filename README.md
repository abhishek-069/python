Introduction to Python Programming
1. What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows developers to write clear and concise programs for both small and large-scale projects.

Python is used for:

Web development

Automation and scripting

Data science and machine learning (e.g., using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow)

Game development

Desktop applications

2. Why is Python Popular?
Easy to Learn: Python’s syntax is simple and close to natural language, making it beginner-friendly.

Cross-Platform: Python works across various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Large Community & Libraries: Tons of support, tutorials, and ready-to-use packages.

3. Setting Up Python Environment
Step 1: Download Python
Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org

Download the latest version for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Windows Tip: During installation, check the option “Add Python to PATH”.

Choose “Install Now” or customize the installation as needed.

Step 2: Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
While Python can be written in any text editor, using an IDE makes development easier.

Popular IDEs/Editors:

VS Code (Recommended) – Lightweight with Python support.

PyCharm – Full-featured professional IDE.

Jupyter Notebook – Great for data science and interactive learning (pip install notebook to install).

Step 3: Verify Installation
Open Command Prompt or Terminal.

Type:

css
Copy
Edit
python --version
or

css
Copy
Edit
python3 --version
to verify Python is installed correctly.

4. Writing Your First Python Program
Step 1: Open a Text Editor or IDE
Use Notepad, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.

Step 2: Write the Code
python
Copy
Edit
print("Hello, World!")
This line prints Hello, World! to the screen.

Step 3: Run the Program
In an IDE: Click the "Run" button.

In Terminal:

Save the file as hello.py

Navigate to the file location.

Run:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python hello.py
5. Python as an Interpreted Language
Python executes code line by line rather than compiling the entire program beforehand like C or Java.

Benefits of being interpreted:

Easier debugging: Errors are shown line by line.

Faster development: You can quickly test and run code without compiling.

6. Key Features of Python
Simple Syntax: Easy to read and write (similar to English).

Interpreted: Executes code line by line.

Dynamically Typed: No need to declare variable types explicitly.

Object-Oriented: Supports classes and objects.

Rich Standard Library: Includes many built-in modules and tools.
